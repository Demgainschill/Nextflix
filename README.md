## Nextflix ( A netflix clone ) 

Right here i had created a netflix clone using nextjs inorder to learn "a lot" about full stack web development.

Inorder to run nextflix we have to run the following command after cloning the repository

clone with the following command 
git clone https://github.com/Demgainschill/Nextflix.git

Once in the Nextflix directory
and Run
"npm run dev"

It will now say the link it is being hosted at a localhost link
lets consider "https://localhost:4000" We must now go to this link
and once we open the webpage we will get a webpage like this

We can see this is the login page and now we login with our specified credentials or through github hooks.

Once we Successfully login we are brought to the main dashboard of "Nextflix" We are shown the recommendations as seen by the dashboard.

We have the ability to see the description as well as the ability to add the movies to the wishlist.
